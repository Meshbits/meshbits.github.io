## [](#tl-dr)TL;DR

[Satinder Grewal] and [Nitin Sharma] are teaming up under the name **Meshbits** to help grow and support the **[Komodo community]**.

Satinder has been contributing by solving various problems for the [Komodo Platform](https://komodoplatform.com) community, by dissipating knowledge and by delivering on his promises such as [BarterDEX](https://github.com/komodoplatform/barterDEX/). And these days he's using his time, money and efforts to help the Komodo ecosystem projects such as [CHIPS](https://chips.cash/), [Pirate Chain](https://pirate.black/) and [Verus](https://verus.io) wherever possiblly he can, along with making development toolkits and frameworks to help the developer community of Komodo ecosystem, such as [kmdgo](https://github.com/satindergrewal/kmdgo), [saplinglib](https://github.com/satindergrewal/saplinglib/), [Khoji Explorer](https://github.com/meshbits/khoji/).

Nitin volunteered his time to setup stable, automated quality infrastructure for the network after both Nitin and Satinder won a Notary Node spot in the Komodo Notary Node 2018 elections.

Long before Meshbits Ltd formed as a legal entity, Satinder has been helping [Komodo Platform](https://komodoplatform.com) project from it's early inception days since 2015 onwards to this day, and we intend to keep investing our time, money, efforts and valuable resources to help grow the [Komodo Platform](https://komodoplatform.com) ecosystem to reach more user-base.
