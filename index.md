## [](#tl-dr)TL;DR

[Satinder Grewal] and [Nitin Sharma] are joining forces under the team name **Meshbits** to help grow and support **[Komodo community]**.

Satinder has been contributing by solving various problems for the community, by dissipating knowledge and by delivering on his promises such as BarterDex.
And now by using his personal funds for running **electrumx servers** and notary nodes.

Nitin has volunteered his time to setup stable, automated quality infrastructure for electrumx servers and notary nodes.

We intend to invest the revenue from notary node operations in growing the Komodo echo system and therefore **we are contesting in Notary Node 2018 elections.**
