## [](#tl-dr)TL;DR

[Satinder Grewal] and [Nitin Sharma] are teaming up under the name **Meshbits** to help grow and support the **[Komodo community]**.

Satinder has been contributing by solving various problems for the community, by dissipating knowledge and by delivering on his promises such as BarterDex.
And now by using his personal funds for running **electrumx servers** and notary nodes.
